Repository for configuration files and other stuff that I may need later

Overall, if you're here for inspiration or something, I guess you could use some stuff from here. Just remember that stuff is more or so customized to my liking so may not be up to your standard.

These configuration files are used across 4+ Proxmox VMs running Debian Bookworm with Podman for containerization.

If you're interested, I write some stuff on my main site and also host some stuff like game servers, anyone is welcome!
