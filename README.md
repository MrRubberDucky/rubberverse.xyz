## Repository of configuration files, bash scripts and other things

If you're looking for my container images, they're under [Rubberverse organization](https://github.com/Rubberverse)

## What is this repository about

This is my way of keeping a nice tidy track of what I change locally without resorting to hours of troubleshooting hell because I knocked myself offline again or changed something that I shouldn't have. It can also serve as a learning repository, I aim for my configuration files to be production-grade meaning you can just copy and paste and have working configuration yourself with some bit of tinkering.

All these files indirectly or directly power my blog, which can be found at following link: [blog.rubberverse.xyz](https://blog.rubberverse.xyz), a tech rambling blog that also hosts some guides and other things. It's a relaxing blog, mostly just focusing on all sorts of things and aiming to have that old familiar "fuck this am not corporate" style of writing. Consider giving it a read if you ever feel bored!

To learn more, consider reading README.md located in `Generic` directory.

## There's something that's wrong!

Leave a GitHub issue and I'll get around to fixing it or maybe explaining why it's that way.
