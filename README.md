## Config Repository for *.rubberverse.xyz
Repository for various configuration files for specific software or systemd services. For Dockerfiles, look at `MrRubberDucky/rubberverse_docker`.

### What is this repository about

This is a way for me to store backups of my configuration files and at the same time make it a learning experience for others just starting into the hobby. You should still research what each option here does but generally most of them are self-documenting and are mostly updated to current standards. They should also be production ready.

Most if not all configuration files here are used in production, if you feel like/or know that something is misconfigured then please create a Issue explaining what's wrong and I'll get around to fixing it.

### What do the numbers mean on the directories?

They're just a way for me to tag different Virtual Machines hosting these and easily see for what a specific configuration was used for internally.
